About
=====

Mellifera is a working proof-of-concept for a time exchange resilient to wealth distribution problems. It encourages active cooperation, knowledge-sharing, and safeguards against uncontrolled deflation. This exchange trades in hour-based local currency. This project is experimental and is undergoing active development.

Roadmap
-------

* Test payments and surplus distribution
* Improved testing on/off switch
* Team contributions/payment
* Improved notifications
* User activity logging
* Refunds and direct debt payment
* User guide / API documentation

v1.0.0

* Devel branch
* Quickpay with QR codes
* Advanced user search
* User profiles
* Global/individual stats/charts
* String localization
* Gravatar support

Theory
------

1. An explanation of money and wealth.
2. Contribution, the start of the Monetary Cycle.
3. Payment and compensation, the end of the Monetary Cycle.
4. The case for shared occupational knowledge and shared surplus.

Time-trading rules
------------------

1. Members may have only one account.
2. Only the owner of an account has say on where its credit is spent.
3. Do not over-report your hours; be honest when accounting for time worked.
4. Do not waste others' time; share knowledge of best practices.
5. Do not waste your own time; use best practices whenever possible, and seek guidance when you need it.
6. Do not hoard money indefinitely; spend it regularly.

Rule 1 ensures that everyone gets the same amount of dividends and liability limit. Rule 2  Rules 3-6 help stabilize the money supply. Failing to abide by these rules causes the community currency to lose its usefulness, and should be grounds for the termination of membership.
