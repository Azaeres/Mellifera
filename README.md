About
=====
Mellifera is a working proof-of-concept for a time-trading free market that could stand a good chance of surviving an automated future. This system acts as a hub of activity for a time-based local currency.

Future features
---------------

* Seizing funds
* Changing liability limit
* Freezing time accounts
* More tests
* Team payment
* User activity logging
* Quickpay
* Advanced user search
* User profiles
* Global stats/charts
* String localization
* Gravatar support

Theory
------

1. An explanation of money and wealth.
2. Contribution, the start of the Monetary Cycle.
3. Payment and compensation, the end of the Monetary Cycle.
4. The case for shared surplus and sharing trade "secrets".

Time-trading rules
------------------

1. Members may have only one account.
2. Only the owner of an account has say on where its credit is spent.
3. Do not over-report your hours; be honest when accounting for time worked.
4. Do not waste others' time; share knowledge of best practices.
5. Do not waste your own time; use best practices whenever possible, and seek guidance when you need it.
6. Do not hoard money indefinitely; spend it regularly.

Rule 1 ensures that everyone gets the same amount of dividends and liability limit. Rule 2  Rules 3-6 help stabilize the money supply. Failing to abide by these rules causes the community currency to lose its usefulness, and should be grounds for the termination of membership.
