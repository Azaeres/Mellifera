Mellifera
=========
This is a working proof-of-concept for a time-trading free market that, in principle, stands a good chance of surviving an automated future. This system acts as a hub of activity for a time-based local currency.

To do:
------
* Jasmine testing framework

* Team payment
* User activity logging
* Quickpay
* Advanced user search
* User profiles

* Changing liability limit
* Freezing/seizing time accounts
* Account collision

* Global stats/charts

Open Economics
--------------

1. An explanation of money and wealth.
2. Contribution, the start of the Monetary Cycle.
3. Payment and compensation, the end of the Monetary Cycle.
4. The case for shared surplus and occupational information.

Time-trading rules
------------------

1. Members may have only one account.
2. Do not over-report your hours; be honest when accounting for time worked.
3. Do not waste others' time; share knowledge of best practices.
4. Do not waste your own time; use best practices whenever possible, and seek guidance when you need it.
5. Do not hoard money indefinitely; spend it regularly.

Rule 1 ensures that everyone gets the same amount of dividends and liability limit. Rules 2-5 help stabilize the money supply. Failing to abide by these rules causes the community currency to lose its usefulness, and should be grounds for the termination of membership.
